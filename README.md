> A Python Tkinter application that simulates a micromouse navigating a maze using the **Flood Fill Algorithm**.  
> Users can design their own maze, set start and end points, and watch the mouse find the optimal path in real-time.

---

## 🔎 Overview

This interactive application allows you to:

- Create custom mazes of any size.
- Set **start** and **end points** for the micromouse.
- Toggle walls and open paths interactively.
- Visualize the **Flood Fill Algorithm** as the mouse calculates distances and moves toward the goal.
- Reset the maze and try different configurations.

Perfect for **learning pathfinding algorithms** and **visualizing maze-solving strategies**.

## ⚡ Features

- Interactive maze builder using Tkinter canvas.
- Set start and end points dynamically.
- Toggle cells between walls and open paths.
- Real-time Flood Fill distance mapping.
- Automatic mouse movement along the optimal path.
- Restart maze and experiment with different layouts.
